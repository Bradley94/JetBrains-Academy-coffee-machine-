# JetBrains-Academy-coffee-machine-
Beginner project simulating a simple coffee machine that has five user-inputted functions, this project is found on hyperskill.org, the test cases unfortunately aren't published for the projects so I cannot link them to this code outside of the website itself.

The project is split into 5 major parts that build upon each other, starting from a very simple program that takes one user input and performs a simple calculation and finishing with a simulation of a coffee machine that is classed based and asks a user to choose from multiple functions.
