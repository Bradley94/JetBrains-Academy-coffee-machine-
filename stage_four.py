"""
Objectives
Write a program that will work endlessly to make coffee for all interested persons until the shutdown signal is given. 
Introduce two new options: "remaining" and "exit".

Do not forget that you can be out of resources for making coffee. If the coffee machine doesn't have enough resources to make coffee, 
the program should output a message that says it can't make a cup of coffee.

And the last improvement to the program at this step â€” if the user types "buy" to buy a cup of coffee and then changes his mind, 
they should be able to type "back" to return into the main cycle.
